# Parts Search User Guide

## How to Use Parts Search

The parts search feature works by building a local database of parts as you browse appliances. Here's how to use it:

### Step 1: Populate the Cache

Since the parts search uses cached data, you need to load some parts first:

#### Option A: Use Sample Data (Quickest)
1. Go to the **Parts** tab
2. Click **"Load Sample Data"** button (appears when cache is empty)
3. This loads parts for model MAV6000AWQ

#### Option B: Browse Appliances
1. Go to the **Appliances** tab
2. Search for an appliance (e.g., "MAV6000AWQ")
3. Click on the appliance card
4. Click **"View Diagrams"**
5. The parts from that model are now cached

### Step 2: Search for Parts

Once you have parts in the cache:

1. Go to the **Parts** tab
2. Enter a search term:
   - **Part Number**: e.g., "W10820039"
   - **Description**: e.g., "seal", "kit", "basket"
3. Optionally select a manufacturer filter
4. Click **Search Parts**

### Example Searches

After loading sample data, try these searches:

- **"W10820039"** - Finds the Hub Kit
- **"seal"** - Finds all parts with "seal" in the description
- **"kit"** - Finds all parts with "kit" in the name
- **"basket"** - Finds the washer basket

### Understanding the Results

Each result shows:
- Part number
- Description
- Current price
- List price (if different)
- Stock status
- Which model it came from
- How it matched (part number or description)

### Tips

1. **The more appliances you view, the better the search becomes**
2. **Cache persists between sessions** - Your data is saved
3. **Model numbers won't work** - Search for part numbers or descriptions
4. **Use the Appliances tab first** - To find and load parts for specific models

### Troubleshooting

**"No parts found"**
- Make sure you've loaded some data first
- Try a simpler search term
- Check if you're searching for a model number instead of a part

**"Cache: 0 parts from 0 models"**
- Click "Load Sample Data" or
- Browse some appliances and view their diagrams first
